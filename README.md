### Hi there, I'm Jens ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate computer scientist by education and an avid open source evangelist since the mid 1990s.
My roots go back to development for the good old AmigaOS platform for which I was developing several different
applications, e.g. [YAM](https://github.com/jens-maus/yam). Some of which you now can find here on GitHub.
I do have records in algorithms design, parallel computing, embedded devices and medical imaging. Especially
during the last years I am mostly working in the field of developing smart home solutions such as
[RaspberryMatic](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic) and other similar projects.

Feel free to file issues and pull-requests in any of the projects I maintain here. Contact me via
email at `mail@jens-maus.de` or on twitter at [@MausJens](https://twitter.com/jens-maus/).
